# DevOps and SRE Research

## What is SRE - Site Reliability Engineer?
Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks.

SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems. 

SRE is a valuable practice when creating scalable and highly reliable software systems. It helps you manage large systems through code, which is more scalable and sustainable for sysadmins managing thousands or hundreds of thousands of machines.

## Are SRE and DevOps the same or different. If different, how?
SRE and DevOps differ but go hand in hand. While SRE provides a unique approach to application lifecycle and service management by incorporating various aspects of software development into IT operations, DevOps reduces the complexity of managing software engineering projects through collaboration and automation.

## What are various tools for setting DevOps?

Top beneficial tools for DevOps are:
- Git
- Gradle
- Selenium
- Jenkins
- Puppet
- Chef
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Ansible
- eG Enterprise.

## Docker

It is an open-source app containerization tool that universalizes the deployment and management of software in isolated containers that can be further launched in different environments - on-premise infrastructure, cloud or without the need to employ resource-heavy hypervisors.

Docker in simple words is a tool or platform design to simplify the process of creating, deploying, and packaging and shipping out applications along with its parts such as libraries and other dependencies. Its primary purpose is to automate the application deployment process and operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. It allows multiple containers to run on the same hardware and provides high productivity, along with maintaining isolated applications and facilitating seamless configuration.
